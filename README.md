[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/03aa4a5d-97de-4392-bfc6-b2dc048f5d56/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-covid19-tracker/deploys)

### [Live Demo](https://react-covid19-tracker.netlify.com/)

I made this app inspired in this [project](https://github.com/alemesa/mapbox-covid19) and this [article](https://dev.to/alemesa/how-to-create-a-covid-19-map-with-mapbox-and-react-3jgf).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To execute this project, clone and after that run:

### `yarn start`

Running the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

NOTE: Remember to put a `.env` file with the Mapbox Access Token, like example bellow:

```
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_GL_TOKEN="my-mapbox-secret-token"
```
You can know more on this [link](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/)
